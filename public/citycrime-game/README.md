   ```

3. **Open in browser**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

4. **Optional: Add Custom Car Model**
   - Place your car.glb file in `game/models/`
   - The game will automatically load your custom model
   - Fallback to default box car if model loading fails

### **Development**
The project uses **ES6 modules** which require a web server (not `file://` protocol) for proper functionality.

   - **Mobile**: Use the virtual joystick with touch jump and brake buttons
   - **Camera**: Use mouse to rotate camera view around your car

3. **🎯 Complete Objectives**
   - Drive around and find the 5 orange boxes scattered across the track
   - Hit them to increase your "Knocked Boxes" counter
   - Avoid brown collision towers to minimize collisions
   - Try jumping over the elevated bridge platform

4. **🏆 Master Advanced Features**
   - Experiment with realistic car physics and aerial jumps
   - Use the dynamic lighting to navigate in low-light conditions
